# Cypress & Zephyr Scale Integration

# Problem Statement: 
I have a project in which the project team wanted to view the test execution of the Cypress test. We also utilise Zypher as our test case management. I have been searching for ways to integrate these two, Zypher & Cypress; however, I can't find a proper solution that fits my need

# Solution: 
I have developed a work-in-progress project to enhance Zypher Scale integration with Cypress. My goal is to introduce a user-friendly update that adds a test cycle every time a cypress test is performed. This update will ensure that each associated test case is promptly updated with a status of either 'Passed,' 'Failed,' or 'Skipped.' With these improvements, it aims to streamline the testing process and provide clearer insights into the test results.
