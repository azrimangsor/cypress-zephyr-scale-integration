# Cypress & Zephyr Scale Integration

Problem Statement:
I have a project which the project team wanted to view the test execution of Cypress test. We also utilise Zypher as our test cases management. I have been searching ways to integrate these two, Zypher & Cypress; however i can't find a propoer solution that fit my need

Solution
I have develop a work-in-progress project to enhance Zypher Scale integration with Cypress. My goal is to introduce a user-friendly update that adds a test cycle every time a cypress test is performed. This update will ensure that each associated test case is promptly updated with a status of either 'Passed,' 'Failed,' or 'Skipped.' With these improvements it aim to streamline the testing process and provide clearer insights into the test results.
